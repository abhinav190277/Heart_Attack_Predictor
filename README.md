ðŸš€ Built with:
- Django (Python web framework)
- Scikit-learn (for training and using ML model)
- HTML/CSS for frontend UI
- Joblib for saving/loading the trained model

ðŸ“Š Users input their health data in a form, and the model returns a percentage likelihood of heart disease risk, helping raise awareness and encourage preventive care.
